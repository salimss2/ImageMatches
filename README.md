# ImageMatches
A simple and fun memory game! 🎮 The user clicks on images to find matching pairs. When two images match, a message appears saying “Congratulations! You found a match 🎉”, and if not, “Try again 😅”. This project trains memory and focuses on practicing interactive programming and event handling.
